### `PULSAR_INSTANCE` Environment Variable

This variable dictates what API server Pulsar uses. Make sure you provide the entire URL, including the `/api/v1` section. **DO NOT** include a trailing backslash.

### Other Environment Variables

As Pulsar makes use of `@sveltejs/adapter-node` for our integrated web server you can use any environment variable that it provides such as `PORT`, `HOST`, or `ORIGIN`. For a reference of these variables, see: [Environment Variables](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/adapter-node#environment-variables).
